A crafting, text-based browser game

I was playing around with some text based games recently and realized they could be a good platform to build a style of game that doesn't require a ton of developer effort, minimal graphics (which I don't have), and still keep fresh and learning a lot of the relevant technologies.

So I came up with this idea

I want the game to be a browser game that is reminiscent of games like Zork and the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy that I saw as a kid ages ages ago, but with modern touches and updates that make it easily accessible.

UPDATE:
I initially built this to explore some Javascript again, but quickly found I needed more frameworks involved (unit testing, communication, maybe ES6 objects), so I got something that's only useable at the most basic level out of it and have paused to pursue other projects until the inspiration for this game strikes again.
